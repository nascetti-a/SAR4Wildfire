# SAR4Wildfire Project Repository 

Project Introduction

In recent years, the world witnessed many devastating wildfires across the globe, from Sweden to Amazon, from California to Australia. Wildfires kill and displace people, damage property and infrastructure, burn vegetation and kill wildlife, pollute the air and cost billions of dollars to fight. Early detection of wildfires, near real-time monitoring of their progression and rapid damage assessment are critical for effective emergency management and decision support. 
With its synoptic view, large area coverage at frequent revisits, satellite remote sensing can play a crucial role in fighting wildfires. The objective of this project is to develop a novel and automatic method, using satellite data and AI, for near real-time wildfire detection, progression monitoring and rapid damage assessment. The timely and reliable information the project generates can be used by fire-fighting authorities to quickly put in the right resources, estimate how fires will develop and continuously assess the damages.
